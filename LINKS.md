# Video editing samples
## Examples of common categories of films
### _Long form documentary:_
>[Scottish Wildlife Trust - Oceans of Value (32 mins)](https://youtu.be/x-fg-mD1SrQ)  
For this project the client approached us after she had already filmed the interviews and was at a loss as to how to proceed.  
Once a brief was agreed I cut the source footage down from 27 hours to 32 minutes.  
The cutaways were sourced from an Orkney-based wildlife broadcast camera operator.   
### _Drama:_  
>[Kent County Council - Fraud and Financial Abuse](https://youtu.be/3KcZIXhrRxw)  
Unsettling music and sound effects add depth to this drama about vulnerable adults.  
### _Event Opening Film:_  
>[Newton - 2021 Conference Promo](https://youtu.be/23cg27VoVzA)  
This event opening film is composed entirely of stock footage and custom graphics.  
[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE)  
Also composed entirely of pre-filmed footage and the client's library of footage.  
### _Promo:_  
>[Scottish Enterprise - Annual Review 2015](https://youtu.be/OnoYiEk2ZnE)  
This was recut in a single night as the client didn't like the v1 of the original brief.  
The footage was repurposed and mixed with stock and the client's library footage.  
### _Current affairs-style documentary reportage:_  
>[Lloyds Banking Group - Customer First TV (Risk episode)](https://youtu.be/RwQuzzzNCbE)  
Glitchy sound effects and moody music bring this Panorama-style video to life.  
### _Presentation:_  
>[Newton Presentation 2024](https://youtu.be/I7ReTu0gRrs)  
The client had a minimal graphics budget here; I used their abstract black cube branding as a background to the text, which they chose from an earlier version.  

## Examples of specific features  
### _Interviewees intercut seamlessly:_  
>[Education Scotland - Outdoor Learning](https://youtu.be/rRa7cL7VpGE)  
A transcript of this video might read as though only one person was speaking throughout, which is appropriate in this case since all the interviewees express the same opinion.  
[NHS Education for Scotland - Mobile Skills Unit Testimonial](https://youtu.be/xj1KGAnKtWM) _(interviewees filmed during lockdown over Teams)_  
This is another example where the participants are closely intercut, at times seeming to continue each other's sentences.  

### _On-brand graphics:_  
>[Napier Innovation Hub - Coghmear](https://youtu.be/Cw7e0ic7Ey4)  
This video for Napier University, part of a series of 25 case studies, has simple but effective on-brand graphics; these were done collaboratively with the client, who selected the phrases to pull out from an initial version of the video; I then created the animations in After Effects according to the brand guidelines.  
[Visit Scotland - Youtube pre-roll ad (Castles promo with German graphics)](https://youtu.be/yT0CJiXv0-U)  
I worked closely with the client to ensure the German text is consistently readable despite being on-screen briefly and in unpredictabe areas of the screen.  
This is also an example of cutting to an exact duration (30 seconds).  

### _Mixing externally supplied graphics with edit suite visual enhancements:_
>[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE)  
For this video I enhanced the edit with punch-ins and colour channel blurring, as well as some other visual effects;  
these were then combined with the externally supplied light paths.  

### _Cutting to beat:_
>[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=rzUqfE_HoayaK_4x&t=43) _(starts at 00:43)_  
Standard cutting from shot to shot on the beat of the track.  
[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=tRd2PAsa6_ph4c9k&t=51) _(starts at 00:51)_  
The robot arm in this shot has been retimed so that its staccato movements are timed with the beat of the track.  

### _Creative use of music and audio:_  
>[NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=8-2eFVx4lMFJgNlG&t=231) _(starts at 03:51)_  
The section of the video that begins at 03:51 has reversed music to create an unsettling feeling.  
[NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=h7mCs0CxmZIC8Cp8&t=470) _(starts at 07:50)_  
The section of the video at 07:50 has music used both as background and coming to the fore as a sound effect to punctuate the nurse's story.  
[Scottish Courts and Tribunal Services - Prison Sentencing](https://youtu.be/8ikps64ec3I?si=H2hRTtyFH2XLLq_2&t=139) _(starts at 02:19)_  
I altered the Audio Network music in the section that begins at 02:19 with an alternative synthesiser from Ableton Live rather than replacing the piece entirely, when one of my colleagues didn't like the original track.  
[Newton - 2023 Conference Promo](https://youtu.be/EafO0Zf-9Q0?si=aKcKGc0h2uB6WT1b)  
I used the audio of the hot air balloons at the start for the astronaut's breathing sound at 01:55, to thematically tie the start and end of the video together.

## Noteworthy early career work  
> [The Recording of Mr Beast](https://youtu.be/InCGES-5KSg?si=RsfI-RrMsqPth3ro&t=0)  
I produced, directed and filmed almost all of this fly-on-the wall documentary made to accompany the release of the album Mr Beast.  
For the live performance segments I was aided by an assistant camera operator.
