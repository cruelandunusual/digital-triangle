# Video editing samples
## _Examples of common categories of films_
### _Long form documentary:_
>[Scottish Wildlife Trust - Oceans of Value (32 mins)](https://youtu.be/x-fg-mD1SrQ)  
This was edited down from 27 hours of interview footage filmed by the client.  
The cutaways were sourced from an Orkney-based wildlife broadcast camera operator.  
### _Drama:_  
>[Kent County Council - Fraud and Financial Abuse](https://youtu.be/3KcZIXhrRxw)  
Unsettling music and sound effects add depth to this drama about vulnerable adults.  
### _Event Opening Film:_  
>[Newton - 2021 Conference promo](https://youtu.be/23cg27VoVzA)  
This event opening film is composed entirely of stock footage and custom graphics.  
[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE)  
Also composed entirely of pre-filmed footage and the client's library of footage.  
### _Promo:_  
>[Scottish Enterprise - Annual Review 2015](https://youtu.be/OnoYiEk2ZnE)  
This was recut in a single night from the original brief as the client didn't like the treatment.  
The footage was repurposed and mixed with stock and the client's library footage.  
### _Presentation:_  
>[Newton Presentation 2024](https://youtu.be/I7ReTu0gRrs)  
The client didn't have a large graphics budget; I used their abstract black cube branding as a text background.  
Also an example of making sure the client's risk warnings are visible and readable.  
### _Current affairs-style documentary reportage:_  
>[Lloyds Banking Group - Customer First TV (Risk episode)](https://youtu.be/RwQuzzzNCbE)  
Glitchy sound effects and moody music bring this to life.

## _Examples of specific features_  
### _Interviewees intercut seamlessly:_  
>[Education Scotland - Outdoor Learning](https://youtu.be/rRa7cL7VpGE)  
A transcript of this video might read as though only one person was speaking throughout, which is appropriate in this instance given that all the teachers speak equally highly of the benefits of outdoor learning.  
[NHS Education for Scotland - Mobile Skills Unit Testimonial](https://youtu.be/xj1KGAnKtWM) _(interviewees filmed during lockdown over Zoom)_  
This is another example where the participants are closely intercut.  

### _On-brand graphics:_  
>[Napier Innovation Hub - Coghmear](https://youtu.be/Cw7e0ic7Ey4)  
This video for Napier University, part of a series of 25 case studies, has simple but effective on-brand graphics; these were done collaboratively with the client, who selected the phrases to pull out from an initial version of the video; I then created the animations in After Effects according to the brand guidelines.  
[Visit Scotland - Youtube pre-roll ad (Castles promo with German graphics)](https://youtu.be/yT0CJiXv0-U)  
I worked closely with the client to ensure the German text is consistently readable despite being on-screen briefly and in unpredictabe areas of the screen.  
This is also an example of cutting to an exact duration (30 seconds).  

### _Mixing externally supplied graphics with edit suite visual enhancements:_
>[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE)  
For this video I enhanced the edit with punch-ins and channel blurring, as well as some other visual effects;  
these were then combined with the externally supplied light paths.  

### _Cutting to beat:_
>[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=rzUqfE_HoayaK_4x&t=43) _(starts at 00:43)_  
Standard cutting from shot to shot on the beat of the track.  
[Scottish Enterprise - Making Scotland's Future](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=tRd2PAsa6_ph4c9k&t=51) _(starts at 00:51)_  
The robot arm in this shot has been retimed so that its staccato movements are timed with the beat of the track.  

### _Creative use of music and audio:_  
>[NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=8-2eFVx4lMFJgNlG&t=231) _(starts at 03:51)_  
The section of the video that begins at 03:51 has reversed music to create an unsettling feeling.  
[NHS Education for Scotland - Bereavement in the A&E](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=h7mCs0CxmZIC8Cp8&t=470) _(starts at 07:50)_  
The section of the video at 07:50 has music used both as background and coming to the fore as a sound effect to punctuate the nurse's story.  
[Scottish Courts and Tribunal Services - Prison Sentencing](https://youtu.be/8ikps64ec3I?si=H2hRTtyFH2XLLq_2&t=139) _(starts at 02:19)_  
I altered the Audio Network music in the section that begins at 02:19 with an alternative synthesiser from Ableton Live rather than replacing the piece entirely, when one of my colleagues didn't like the original track.

## _Noteworthy early career work_  
>[The Recording of Mr Beast](https://youtu.be/InCGES-5KSg?si=RsfI-RrMsqPth3ro&t=0)
