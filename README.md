# Peter Smith editor
## About me

I am an experienced video editor looking to further develop my career. I am seeking a role in an organisation that will offer me interesting career development opportunities and progression, and I believe Baillie Gifford will give me those opportunities.

## Experience / Technical and Professional skills  

I have been a filmmaker for over twenty years; from 2008 until 2024 I was a full-time in-house agency editor, where I primarily edited corporate communications for both public and private sector clients such as the NHS, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise, Lloyds Banking Group, Edinburgh University, Newton Investment Management, among many others.  

Since being made redundant in late 2024 I have taken a career break, but continued to hone my editing skills with some self-directed projects using footage from EditStock.  

I am highly experienced with both `Premiere Pro` and `Final Cut Pro`, and also have experience of `DaVinci Resolve` and `Avid Media Composer`. I am very comfortable with `After Effects` and `Adobe Audition`, having used both extensively throughout my career, and am also experienced with `Adobe Photoshop` and `Illustrator` and the `Microsoft Office` suite.

## Critical Skills  
### Adaptability  
I am comfortable identifying knowledge gaps in my own understanding, and am willing to adapt to new ways of working. Throughout my career I have consistently sought new learning opportunities; for example, I have never formally studied any aspects of film making, I mainly learned by doing.  

Additionally, over the years I have taught myself motion graphics techniques as well as sound design and basic music composition.  

However, no one learns in a vacuum, and I recognise that I gained an enormous amount from a strong network of peers and mentors; I also have experience of having been a mentor to a younger colleague while at Republic Productions, and I grew personally and professionally from that experience also.  

Aside from my creative skillset, I have a strong technical skillset from my prior experience working in IT. For instance, throughout my video editing career I actively integrated coding into workflows; I have written fairly complex JavaScript expressions in After Effects; I have written Python in Blender 3D to create and animate 3D objects; and I have written Bash scripts to generate disk usage reports on a RAID storage network while at Speakeasy Productions.  

My role at Republic Productions involved maintaining the IT systems of the company; I managed a small network of Windows machines, remotely installing upgrades and security patches. At Speakeasy Productions I was involved in gaining Cyber Essentials certification.  


### Storytelling

Having edited professionally for 20 years, I am a highly adaptable editor with a flexible approach, and I have a huge range of experience across various genres and formats:  
* [long form documentary](https://youtu.be/x-fg-mD1SrQ?si=HdyVZPs6ZJurfGOg)
* [drama](https://youtu.be/tPjJxcLPt9A?si=s4q-WC3EWJ8PnWMn)
* [event opening films](https://youtu.be/EafO0Zf-9Q0)
* [bespoke technical presentations](https://youtu.be/yvql0oVCLIU)
* [current affairs-style reportage](https://youtu.be/RwQuzzzNCbE)

#### Interviews
>I feel I have a strength for cutting interviews; when the material allows, I endeavour to intercut the participants in such a way that they seamlessly flow from one speaker to the next.  
>For instance, a transcript of [this video for Education Scotland](https://youtu.be/rRa7cL7VpGE) might read as though only one person was speaking throughout, which is appropriate in this instance given that all the teachers speak equally highly of the benefits of outdoor learning.  
>[This NHS video](https://youtu.be/xj1KGAnKtWM) is another example where I used this technique effectively.  

#### Promos
>I am also experienced at cutting promos where the emphasis is on the interplay of the visuals and the music; [this event opening film for Scottish Enterprise](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=rzUqfE_HoayaK_4x) has examples of [cutting to different shots on the beat](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=rzUqfE_HoayaK_4x&t=43), and also having the action [synchronise with the beat](https://youtu.be/RAalmdrNasE?si=tRd2PAsa6_ph4c9k&t=51) of some shots (the robot arm in this example).  
>The video is also a good example of integrating graphics done by an external motion graphics artists, with the animated light paths provided by them, and the picture scaling effect synchronised with the beat done by me.  

#### Graphics
>[This video for Napier University](https://youtu.be/Cw7e0ic7Ey4), part of a series of 25 case studies, has simple but effective on-brand graphics; these were done collaboratively with the client, who selected the phrases to pull out from an initial version of the video, and I then created the animation in After Effects according to the brand guidelines.  
>[This VisitScotland Youtube pre-roll advert](https://youtu.be/yT0CJiXv0-U) for the German market has German text throughout, often on screen briefly and in unpredictabe areas of the screen; it required close collaboration with the client to ensure consistent readability. It's also a good example of cutting to an exact duration (30 seconds).  

#### Sound / Music
>I also take great pride in sound and music editing. [This video for the NHS](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=8-2eFVx4lMFJgNlG), recorded over Teams during the pandemic to inform the NHS workforce about workplace bereavement, has creative use of sound and music, inluding [reversed music to create an unsettling feeling](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=8-2eFVx4lMFJgNlG&t=231) and music [used as a sound effect, to punctuate the nurse's story](https://youtu.be/s7G6mfRpoCU?si=h7mCs0CxmZIC8Cp8&t=470).  
>Also, in [this video for the Scottish Courts and Tribunal Services](https://youtu.be/8ikps64ec3I?si=H2hRTtyFH2XLLq_2&t=139), I altered the Audio Network track that begins at 02:20 with an alternative synthesiser in Ableton Live rather than replacing the track entirely, when one of my colleagues didn't like the sound of the original.  


> [!NOTE]  
> At times I have worked to challenging deadlines; [this annual review video for Scottish Enterprise](https://youtu.be/OnoYiEk2ZnE) was recut in a single _(long!)_ night when the client didn't like the v1 of the original brief. The re-edit repurposed the footage (the black and white shots of SE employees) along with shots from SE's library, and some stock shots.

### Team working  
I have strong written and speaking communication skills and am always conscious of my audience and their level of technical expertise.  

Having made videos for a variety of clients from different industries and sectors, I have demonstrated a strong ability to quickly absorb and understand information relating to subjects where I have limited or non-specialist knowledge. Because of this, I feel I am particularly capable of distilling and communicating complex information to wide audiences.  

Additionally, an essential part of the role of an editor is listening to and implementing feedback from clients, team members and other stakeholders, which has taught me the value of listening to all contributions.  

In my previous role at Speakeasy Productions, and also from my time as a software developer at Agilent in Germany, I have gained valuable experience working across multi-disciplinary teams, and in teams with colleagues whose first language wasn't English. In particular, at Agilent each member of my development team took turns to host our team meetings, which required clear communication, patient and respectful interactions with colleagues, and encouraged me to express ideas using jargon-free language. I also occasionally hosted these meetings in German.  

## Summary  

I believe I would be a good fit for Baillie Gifford; I am highly skilled, motivated, adaptable, and eager to continue growing in my career. I thrive in supportive, collaborative team environments where the work is both varied and challenging, and I aspire to be a supportive, positive colleague.
