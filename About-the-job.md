### How to Apply

Email us at `jobs@digitaltriangle.co.uk` telling us why you would be great for this position. Also `send a link to some of your most recent work` you are proud of `and let us know what your role was in producing it` (we understand that you don’t always have control of all aspects) - if you don't do either of these things your chances of being shortlisted are very slim.


### The Application Process

There is no hard deadline for applications - we will remain open until we have a strong shortlist to work from so if you are thinking of applying then please do it as soon as you can so as not to miss out.

Once a shortlist has been selected we will invite them to an in-person interview at our studio in Leith. As part of this stage of the process we will provide some sample footage, a short brief and will ask you to produce a short edit for us to review ahead of the interview.

We will endevour to get back to everyone who applies either way.
